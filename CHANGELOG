0.0.5 (2021-02-04)
==================
- ANNOUNCEMENT! python2.7 support for osfclient is in jeopardy!  With python2.7 officially deprecated
  and PyPI ceasing 2.7 support, the value of 2.7 support is questionable.  This is the last release
  that has definite py2.7 compatibility.  Going forward, the maintainers will start treating
  osfclient as a py3-only project.  This will include several refactorings to help modernize the
  osfclient codebase (ex. linting, test refactoring, dependency updates).  We will not consider
  2.7-compatibility a prereq for merging PRs or releasing.  We will however consider patches to add
  / maintain 2.7 support, if submitted.  The submitter will be responsible for ongoing 2.7 support.
